## Pre-Processing

Data pre-processing is an essential and foundational step in the journey from raw data to meaningful insights. It serves as a crucial bridge that ensures the quality, accuracy, and reliability of the subsequent analyses or machine learning models. This preliminary phase involves a series of techniques and transformations that clean, structure, and enhance the raw data, making it more amenable for downstream processing.

Data pre-processing is both an art and a science, demanding domain knowledge and analytical acumen. Choices made during this phase can profoundly impact the final outcomes

Basically in our project, after the extraction of data from excel to csv, I have try to remove the duplicate data, clean the null values and also replace with their mean, median or mode as per needed. This is one of the basic process step where all the project of data science or data analyst have gone while once through it. After re-checking the null and duplicates values I have tried to analyse the date-time of dataset where I have revaluate in correct order or sequence. Now the data is ready to go on further steps.

## Visualizatioin


Visualization is more than just aesthetics; it's a medium through which complex ideas are distilled into intuitive images. Effective visualization transcends language barriers, enabling data-driven storytelling that resonates across diverse audiences. Ultimately, this process bridges the gap between data and decision-making, enabling analysts to distill patterns, outliers, and relationships that might otherwise remain obscured, facilitating more informed choices and insights.

Visualization is the artistic and informative facet of data analysis, transforming raw numbers into visual narratives that facilitate understanding, reveal patterns, and unveil insights. This process involves selecting appropriate visualization techniques, crafting meaningful representations, and conveying complex information in a digestible manner.

In this project I have done the two vizualization one in before the statistical analysis and second one is after the analysis. The first Visualization which is done before analysis is used to understand the data into deep. It elaborate the whole dataset in wide manner or give the better understanding of data inside the dataset. This Visualization is generally used to find the pattern or anomoly which help to analyst check the data nature. After the statistical analysis visualization is used to find the difference in between before and after analysis graphs. In after visualization.

Before and after the application of statistical analysis visualization, data remains a sea of potential insights, awaiting translation into actionable knowledge. The "before" phase encompasses raw data, a labyrinth of numbers and attributes that lack coherent structure or meaning. At this stage, patterns and trends are hidden beneath layers of complexity, making it difficult for even seasoned analysts to discern meaningful information.

Enter statistical analysis visualization, the transformative "after" phase. This is where data gains a visual voice, speaking in the language of graphs, charts, and interactive plots. The abstract becomes tangible, as relationships and trends emerge from the visual representations. Complex statistics find resonance in these visual cues, enabling immediate comprehension and deep insights.

The "before" is a realm of potential, and the "after" is where potential is realized. Visualizations distill intricate statistical results into a form that is accessible to a wider audience, transcending the barriers of technical jargon. Decision-makers, stakeholders, and experts from various domains can all grasp the story told by the data.

I use multiple Visualization libraries for this such as
1. Seaborn
2. Matplotlib
3. Plotly
4. Scipy.stat
